About audiocomms 7260 configurations.

In terms of audio features, 7160 variants as well as 7260 variants
need the same set of configuration files.

To avoid doing extrawork at compile time. Only one set of audio
configuration files is generated. Once this done, the set is copied
into the other variants.
